# Prerequisites

The Prerequistes required for solving Arrays_Hashing problems are

## 1. Dynamic Arrays
Understanding how dynamic arrays work, including resizing, indexing, insertion, deletion, and amortized time complexity. In Java, this primarily involves using arrays and `ArrayList`.

## 2. Hashing (Usage & Implementation)
Understanding hashing concepts such as key-value mapping, collision handling, load factor, and resizing. Practical usage includes Java’s `HashMap` and `HashSet` for optimizing time complexity.

## 3. Prefix Sums
Understanding how to construct prefix sum arrays and use them for range queries and subarray problems. Prefix sums are often combined with hashing for efficient solutions.
