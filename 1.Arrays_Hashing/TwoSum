## Question

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

#First Answer
Approcahing by brute force like iterating through arr and findng the target value by value=target-nums[i];
Time Complexity = O(n square)
Space Complexiy= O(1)

##Secind Answer Using HashMap
 create a hashmap and add values as key and index as key 
 iterating through each element and finding value by subtracting the element from target and checking if it already exists in hasmap if exists we reutn the keys
 and if not we will add the value in hashmap
