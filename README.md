# DSA-Tracker

DSA Tracker is my personal system for learning and revising Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. Each problem is documented in a fixed, interview-focused format covering intuition, algorithms, clean Java code, complexity analysis, use cases, and common mistakes.

##  Goals
- Master DSA patterns through NeetCode 250
- Build strong problem-solving intuition
- Maintain consistent daily practice
- Create a long-term revision-ready knowledge base

##  Learning Approach
For every problem, I follow a structured workflow:
1. Attempt the problem independently
2. Identify the underlying pattern
3. Implement a clean Java solution
4. Analyze time and space complexity
5. Document intuition, mistakes, and insights

## Progress Tracking
Progress is tracked in `Progress.md`, including:
- Total problems solved
- Category-wise progress
- Daily problem log

## Commitment
- Consistent daily practice
- One problem at a time
- Focus on understanding over memorization
